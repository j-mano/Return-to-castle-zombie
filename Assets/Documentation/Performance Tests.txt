This document shows testresults from different performance test.
Different api is tested in the unity enginge to test performance differences.

The test itself is biuld up to run certend amount of enimes and towers and run the game to get and avarage fps with the fps counter i build into the game itself.

Vulkan is supported by windows and Linux.

      Note: the cpu usage here is over all cpu cores. when looking at the load on the cpu in the windows performance manager couild i see all the load on a few cores instead of all 16 treads.
